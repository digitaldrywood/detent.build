# GitHub Webhook Freshness

[Back to README](../README.md#documentation)

Each GitHub-backed project can opt into near-real-time external updates by
setting a webhook secret in its `WORKFLOW.md`:

```yaml
tracker:
  kind: github
  github_status_source: label
  repository: digitaldrywood/detent
  github_webhook_secret: $DETENT_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
polling:
  interval_ms: 60000
  conditional: true
```

Set `DETENT_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the Detent process environment. Configure
the repository webhook with:

- Payload URL: `https://<detent-host>/api/v1/webhooks/github`
- Content type: `application/json`
- Secret: the same high-entropy value
- Events: Issues, Pull requests, Check suites, and Labels

Detent verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` with HMAC-SHA256, routes the delivery only
to projects whose configured repository and secret match, and queues a fetch for
the affected issue. Pull-request and check-suite deliveries resolve Detent's
issue from its generated branch name. A repository-level label event has no
single issue target, so it queues a normal conditional refresh. Unknown
repositories never trigger a fleet-wide fallback. See GitHub's
[webhook signature validation](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/validating-webhook-deliveries)
and [event payload reference](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads).

For a ProjectV2 tracker spanning multiple repositories, omit `tracker.repository`
to let the connector verify project membership after signature validation. Set
`tracker.repository` when the project is repository-scoped and strict routing is
preferred.

GitHub must be able to reach the payload URL. For local testing, GitHub documents
[forwarding deliveries with smee.io](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/handling-webhook-deliveries).
For a persistent host without public ingress, an outbound tunnel such as a
[Cloudflare Tunnel published application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/#2a-publish-an-application)
can route a public HTTPS hostname to Detent. Configure relays and reverse proxies
to preserve the raw request body and GitHub signature headers; modifying either
causes signature verification to fail.
